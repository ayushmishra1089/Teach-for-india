            <p class="text-small">
              The Teach For India Fellowship is an opportunity for India's
              brightest and most promising individuals, from the nation’s best
              universities and workplaces, to serve as full-time teachers to
              children from underserved communities in some of the nation’s most
              under-resourced schools. Through this experience of teaching in
              classrooms and working with key education stakeholders like
              students, principals and parents, our Fellows get exposed to the
              grassroot realities of India’s education system and begin to
              cultivate the knowledge, skills, and mindsets necessary to attain
              positions of leadership in education and identify their role in
              building a wider movement for educational equity in the country.
              Our Fellows transform the life paths of children in their
              classroom, and in turn, transform themselves towards leadership in
              educational equity. Our Fellows are placed as full-time teachers,
              for 2 years, in government or low-income private schools. They
              teach English, Mathematics, Science and Social Studies, in
              English, across Grades 1 to 10. Teach For India Fellows teach
              on-ground in Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad,
              Kolkata, Mumbai and Pune. Given the current reality, we are
              continuing the blended model of asynchronous and synchronous
              learning, but as state COVID advisories permit, we have begun
              returning to classrooms full time.

              In our Fellows, we look for leaders to join a movement towards
              educational equity. Aside from passion and commitment to the
              movement, we look for leadership potential that can develop
              through the two-year Fellowship. Our Fellows must possess skills
              such as critical thinking, problem solving, setting and achieving
              ambitious goals, and have a high bar of expectations for
              themselves and others. They must demonstrate interpersonal skills
              through their interactions with various stakeholders, along with
              academic excellence. We look for diversity in our cohort. Our
              Fellows come from across the world representing over 300 college
              campuses and companies, with varied life experiences, expertise
              and professional experiences. Our cohorts include college
              graduates, working professionals, and entrepreneurs. In order to
              be eligible to apply to the Fellowship, you must be an Indian
              Citizen or an Overseas Citizen of India, you must have graduated
              with a minimum of a Bachelor's degree by June/July 2023, and this
              must be your first application to the 2023 cohort of the Teach For
              India Fellowship. Note that prior teaching experience is not
              necessary to apply to the Teach For India Fellowship. We provide
              rigorous training to all Fellows to set them up for success in
              their classrooms.
